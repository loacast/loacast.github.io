I need to go back and find the specific snippets, but Bruce Potter, Dan Kaminsky, and others I have watched over the years have stated the importance of new people presenting and that the best experience of these cons is from presenting. I also had the benefit of a very supportive team at Alcorn Group supporting my first submission to CrikeyCon 2018.</p><h2 id=call-for-papers>Call for Papers</h2><p>I have submitted CFP&rsquo;s to a few conventions at this point, and I have succeeded at a couple (though one fell through nearer to event date). Without having joined a review board for CFP submissions, I still think I have seen a pattern in the talks which were accepted. Each successful CFP has been on an area where I had substantial passion and drive. CrikeyCon 2018 my session was about a Raspberry Pi based network KVM that I had been working on for nearly two years (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5meK6Ty0oSc">HD am I in the middle - CrikeyCon 2018</a>). In this latest case, with AusCert 2022, I am running a .NET Thick App Pentesting workshop which mixes a substantial area of growth in my personal experience with a obsession with learning new things and teaching others.</p><p>The CFP submissions opened in December 2021 and had two deadlines, the 10th of January to get feedback from the committee, and a final dealine of the 30th of January. I sumbitted around the 4th of January.</p><p>I actually submitted two CFP&rsquo;s for AusCert 2022, one a presentation breaking down the failure modes I have seen in .NET applications in the wild, and the second successful CFP to run a .NET Pentesting workshop. The CFP process was fairly straightforward, several paragraphs to describe what I intended to walkthrough in a form on the AusCert site, and the CFP&rsquo;s were away.</p><p>I am trying to re-acquire my initial CFP submissions to include here, and will update if I get them.</p><h3 id=update-original-cfp>Update: Original CFP</h3><p>I received an email back from AusCert with my initial submissions. I find it quite interesting looking back on this after the fact. There is a lot of rushed and not very well described ideas here, and I think my submission was little more than my initial scribbling of an outline and thoughts for the presentation, especially the first. I was a lot more concrete on the second, which is probably a big lesson to learn&mldr; Anyway here they are:</p><h4 id=bringing-the-streetlamp-to-native-client-assessments>Bringing the streetlamp to native client assessments</h4><pre tabindex=0><code>Native client assessments have proven to be a continual source of architectural weaknesses which would be considered grave beyond measure in a web application but somehow they lie dormant in a variety of native client-server enterprise systems.

Contrast the ready ability of layperson computer enthusiasts to identify security issues in Web Applications. Use for a recent example the discovery of social security numbers on the Missouri state teachers website, by using the &#34;view-source&#34; feature to see content provided by the website, but not rendered in a viewable manner by the web browser.

Why big bugs hide in native client applications

Discuss several aspects of native client application architecture that provide a false sense of security to developers, and which also hinder external assessment
 - The assumption of control
 - Greater complexity

An overview of common issues found in native client applications
- Misplaced business logic
- Custom network protocols

What can the infosec industry do:
Make a call to action to the pentesting industry for the further development of tools and methodologies to address the discussed difficulties and to improve offerings for clients

For the enterprises: 
A further call to action to engage in third party architecture assessments during development, and to require such as a procurement requirement.  Encourage SSDLC training and incorporating the OWASP Proactive Security Controls. For existing projects, encourage pentesting and code reviews to provide enterprises a better understanding of the security ramifications to support decision making around enterprise software systems.
</code></pre><h4 id=penetration-testing-of-net-client-applications>Penetration Testing of .NET client applications</h4><pre tabindex=0><code>Participants will be provided a custom developed .NET client application with many of the faults described below. The purpose of the workshop will be to demonstrate using introspection tools such as DNSpy to inspect the internal operation of a .NET application and to exploit these common vulnerabilities. 

This will be of value to persons engaged in the information security / penetration testing specialty who wish to extend their capabilities for testing native client applications. It will also be of value for persons who wish to understand better the risks posed by these architectural weaknesses in native client applications.

Areas of focus:
- Blackbox Client Assessments
-- Network Communications
-- Filesystem Interaction
-- OS Interaction
- The .NET platform
-- Common Intermediate Language
-- Interpreted execution
- Exploration of .NET Applications
-- DNSpy
-- Setting Breakpoints
-- Interacting with calls and memory
- Instrumentation of .NET Applications
-- Finding a Landing Ground
-- Intercepting execution
-- Invoking Interesting Functionality
- How Native Clients Break
-- Demonstration of Vulnerabilities
</code></pre><h2 id=feedback>Feedback</h2><p>On the 19th, I got asked for some additional data for my workshop session:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Thank you for submitting &#34;Penetration testing of .NET client applications&#34; presentation for consideration into the AusCERT2022 Conference program. The program committee have provided the following feedback:
Please provide clarity/understanding of the following
1.	More detail/specificity on presentation content required 
2.	What angle will this be presented from?
3.	What will attendees learn/gain from the presentation?
</code></pre><p>My response was:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Thank you for reaching out about my proposed workshop session. 
 
This workshop would be targeted at persons with some existing web application testing experience, and provide an overview of the additional attack surfaces, failure modes, and testing complexity inherit in thick client assessments. This will be done through a hands-on workshop and demonstration of evaluating security risks existing within a DotNET client application. DotNET applications can be readily decoded back into readable application code, unlike C++ or similar compiled languages. This lends to DotNET being an excellent waypoint between web app testing and thick client assessments.
 
The content will follow the following topics:
•	Assessing applications from a zero-knowledge perspective
  o	Black-box thinking – Looking at the application inputs and outputs
•	Thick client attack surface
  o	Network Communications
  o	Filesystem Interaction
  o	OS Interaction (Registry entries, system calls)
•	Fundamentals of the DotNET platform
  o	The CIL interpreter
•	Setting up an environment to intercept and interact with a DotNET client
  o	Network interception
  o	System, network, and registry calls
  o	Attaching a DotNET debugger
•	Runtime manipulation through a debugger
  o	Setting breakpoints
  o	Manipulating memory to affect application execution
•	Using instrumentation to call application functionality
  o	Injecting attack code into an application
  o	Invoking sensitive functionality directly
•	Tales from the field – Describing real world thick client vulnerabilities
 
The overall intent of the training will be to give web application penetration testers an initial exposure to thick client penetration testing, and practical experience with tools for performing DotNET assessments. 
 
I hope this further assists in understanding the intention and format of the proposed workshop.
</code></pre><h2 id=the-nervous-wait>The nervous wait</h2><p>So the final deadline came and went, and so started the nervous wait to hear back from AusCert. On the 25th of February, I got two emails. Unfortunately, I read this one first:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Dear Clinton,

Thank you for submitting your presentation for consideration into the AusCERT2022 Conference program.

We received a large volume of presentation submissions for consideration and the AusCERT2022 Program Committee spent a great deal of time carefully reviewing each one. The calibre of submissions received was incredibly high and it was a difficult task to select presentations for the main program and even fewer for the workshop days.

Unfortunately, on this occasion, we regret to advise you that your below submission has not been accepted to the 2022 conference program.

I first went down in 2016 to attend a Hak5 Meetup when Darren was down to present at AusCert. From that meetup I met Dook, one part of the driving force for SecTalks Brisbane and started the chain of networking that led to meeting Wade and starting my InfoSec career.</p><p><img src=/img/posts/auscert2022/Contender.jfif alt="Playing &amp;ldquo;The Contender&amp;rdquo; card game with the Hak5 meetup, GC 2016">

The main takeaways I want to put out there is that doing a CFP isn&rsquo;t hard, and that it is 100% worth having a go. I did my first CFP to CrikeyCon within months of starting at Alcorn Group. I want to see more of our fresh faces up on stage learning their craft from both the learning and the teaching angle.</p><h2 id=further-updates-and-other-cfp-resources>Further updates and other CFP resources</h2><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6936941613956874242/>Advice on CFP submissions from BsidesMelbourne on LinkedIn</a></p></div><p class=meta>Posted on <span class=postdate>18.
